Learning  Projects, Ideas, Visions and much more stuffs...
Hello World! My name is Mikjail and I'm an begginer in Github. I'm just arriving home from my university and the first thing that I wanted to do after I arrived was to sign up and learn all about this. This will help me alot with all the projects that I have in mind.

Regards.

Mikjail Salazar.
